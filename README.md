# Neuroparticles (v2.0)

Each particle is powered by its own cellular automaton, acting as a movement engine. Instead of updating a global field like traditional CA, each agent uses its CA rule set to perceive its local environment and decide how to move. These particles interact, compete, cooperate, and evolve - creating rich and unpredictable dynamics.
